make checkbox highlight and hover and focused better

convert:
- ContextWidget
- ScrollBar
- ScaleWidget

make sure everyplace that sets a tabindex does it only if they have a non-empty rect

dark mode
- checkbox in menu

icon browser for builtin icons
- load only a few icons each frame

try animating a fade
- does Options need a separate alpha?

punchlist for podcast app:
- equal-sized weight option to boxlayout
- arbitrarily long scroll?
- bitmaps
- textentry needs to be able to paste a url


debugging:
- highlight widgets that are causing CueFrames?
- show layout somehow (mouseover?)
- maybe just a separate floating window that shows a tree-view of all the widgets
  - mouseover to highlight the widget?

copy other widgets from imgui

textlayout:
- minSizeForChild should recalc based on the four corners

if Options being copied a lot is a problem, then:
- split out things you rarely change into a pointer (most style stuff)
- instead of copying, do a tuple that points to a backing Options for stuff it doesn't override

options should have an explicit "rect" thing where the child doesn't ask the parent for a rect and doesn't report it's size, it just draws at that location (from the parent's screenRectScale), it's out of the normal flow

split gravity into 2 0-1 values plus a text baseline?

hover and highlight properties need to propogate down to children so that icons can draw properly in buttons where the button is highlighted but not the icon directly?
- maybe set and reset global options?
  - but then need to save for deferred rendering
  - maybe as part of the giant Options struct?


PathStroking with thickness
- endcaps?
- need to adjust points if they are too close together or angle is too acute
  - on acute angle side and do line intersection
    - so we have points a,b,c where b is the current intersection point above p
    - if the angle from p to a is on the wrong side of b, then project a onto the line from p to b to ensure convexness
  - on other side, do line intersection
    - but set some maximum on the length of the point from p


dialog
- maybe a flag on floatingwindow?
- have a separate function that does the nextWindowCleanup
  - always call in deinit, but also user can call that and get result if the user pressed esc
  - are there other things a user could press?
- rss textentry should bubble up the enter that it doesn't process so the dialog can record that it should "submit"

stacking order of child windows?
- each window's children are on top of their parent, but the stacking order of the children can be altered
- window.floating_windows
  - during a frame it only has windows that are ancestors of the current window
  - at the end when we finally pop the render queue it will reget all windows in stacking order
- windows persist a stacking list of children (along with positions in renderqueue)
  - init
    - child window records start in parent's deferredrenderqueue
    - child does FloatingWindowAdd
  - deinit
    - child window records end in parent's deferredrenderqueue
    - child pops itself from window.floating_windows
  - deferredrenderpop does it in stacking order and re-adds FloatingWindowData

popups need to have a scrollarea
- scrollarea needs to not show the scrollbar if no need
- also main window and floating windows
- probably default layouts for those should be a vertical scrollarea with showing the scrollbar only when needed (and when not showing it don't scroll past the beginning or end)

maybe use stb_truetype or whatever so we don't need sdl_ttf?
- translate-c is failing for a few of the functions

popups need to bubble up tab event so that the root menu can decide what to do with it
- File/Edit menu moves to next item_prev
- all other menus do nothing

menu/submenu keyboard nav

change cursorlayout from top-to-bottom to left-to-right with optional extra floating widgets that get routed around
- save info for each line
  - size and baseline offset
  - height is max of (height of items without baseline) and max of (max of baselines, max of underhangs) of items with baselines
  - if new size/baseline is different, CueFrame()
- replace menubar horizontal box with textlayout so that lots of menus will wrap

baseline alignment
- maybe only inside TextLayout?
- vertical alignment needs additional .baseline
- rectFor provides baseline float offset from top of rect
- minSize needs to send baseline offset
- PlaceIn honors .baseline alignment

make Alt do special stuff with the menubar

scroll area scroll to newly-focused widget?

forms where you can press "enter" in a form field and it clicks the ok button
- also "esc" clicks the cancel button
- maybe a FormWidget that wraps those
  - bubbleEvent can catch "enter" from text entry
  - FormEvent() call for user side to use on button press that creates and bubbles an event?


ability to use gui floating windows alongside a game
- addEvent should return whether gui wants the event or not

need to free widgets that are allocated on the arena
- like TextWidget does it


scroll widget when stuff is being added/deleted
- lock to top if there previously
- scroll to bottom if there previously
- otherwise scroll to widget that was in the middle?


flag whether the app should show the mouse cursor

try to implement on initial client screen
- focus widget id
- next frame focus widget id
- modal dialog id (controls which widgets accept events)
- animation info
- ui scale factor for current frame

try a simple layout
- couple of nested boxes with buttons and text entries
- click to show a modal dialog
  - animate the dialog appearing
- animate a button disappearing



get line height from font instead of doing it ourselves

do client intro screen with imgui

add slow and fast ship regen

map out a base defense scenario
- each phase has ships attack, then a reward upgrade
- base always has a fighter for you, gen one if none
  - base has missiles?
- start with each player in a fighter patrolling
 - waypoints 500, -400, 100, 200, -400, 300
- phase 1: fighter (per player) attacks, reward is frigate (with plasma and probes)
- phase 2: multiple fighters attack, reward is missiles on frigate
- phase 3: 2 frigates plus fighters, reward is mines on frigate
- phase 4: 2 cruisers holding fighters, reward is cruiser (with everything)
- phase 5: destroyer, 2 cruisers (with fighters), 2 frigates


asteroid fields:
- when generating, generate annotation circles on lattice points in addition to asteroids perturbed from lattice points
- annotation circles should fade in as you zoom out

pilot ai
plasma ai
missile ai


map terrain (how to render these things?)
- nebulas (affect visiblity)
- relay/sensors (indestructible large radar things that you can switch factions by touching)
- gravity wells (affect motion)
- ether flows (affect thrust)
- asteroid fields (do they move?)
- mine fields (do they regenerate mines?)
  - maybe a mine generator that slowly pumps out mines (directional?)
  - mines move away from each other?
  - mines die after a long time?
- hostile areas (enemies show up when you are in there)
- radiation areas (you slowly lose hp)
- wormholes

story scenarios (each scenario introduces a new technique
- piloting (scouting run, start in scout fighter - no plasma)
- docking (have to dock with mothership)
- hangar (mothership overwhelmed, have to escape in scout)
- warping
- missiles
- cannon
- probes
- mines

base defense scenario
- try incorporating some stuff from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fXE-E1hjKk
  - waves of stuff to make it feel less static
  - maybe a period at the beginning where you're just doing normal stuff
  - then a wave of fighters
  - then a pause while you do something to power up your ship
  - then a wave of frigates
  - then a pause
  - then the big boss
    - when he's half dead give him a new power
